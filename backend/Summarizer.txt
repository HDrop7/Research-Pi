Types of summaries used in LLMs:
 - Extractive
    * Pulls out key sentences and combines them
    * Good for preventing hallucinations
    * Doesn't produce a coherent summary
 - Abstractive
    * Mimics a human, creates new sentences based on the main points
    * May induce hallucinations
    * Can result in nice to read summaries
 - Hybrid
    * A combination of both
    * One pass retrieves important sentences
    * Another pass combines them into a summary 

Issues
 - Our input is large, and LLMs context windows are not
    * A multi-pass approach is needed
 - We have pdf input and we need to extract text 
 - If we do a hybrid, it will get more expensive
    * Might be a problem for local models 
 - Hallucinations are a serious problem we need to avoid
 
Method:
 - Divide up extracted pdf text into groups of pages for input into the LLM
 - Go page group by page group, using the model to select a few sentences from each.
 - Then read these select sentences and create a more coeherent final response.
